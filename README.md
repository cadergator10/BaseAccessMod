# Base Access Mod
A minecraft mod dedicated to allowing access to certain individuals and restricting that of others

Why hello there? I know what you might be thinking...
"Mate! There be nothing bloody HERE!"

I see what you mean, and I'm here to say yes... there is no mod yet. That's cause I'm Learnding :D

I want to make a mod which allows the user to secure their base from players and to configure access for certain individuals. Give people a card they can use to open doors or turn on contraptions and be able to modify access on the fly.

But why did I decide to make this? Well, opensecurity is INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT for most users to set up as well as can be hard on the server with all those mods and computers all around. I actually made a system for that that works pretty well, but I want to expand on that. Apart from opensecurity, the mod Securitycraft "does" have card readers, but THEY SUCK! It's boring and not complex enough. The entire mod kind of revolves around the physical security of blocks (eg: can't break in) rather than logical security like card readers, motion detecting, etc. and that's what I want to make. 

Feel free to give me ideas on what I could add if I figure out how to do it cause as I said, I am actively learning mod development (mineacademy is cool) Here are some ideas for stuff I want to add (some names work in progress):

1. Base Terminal - hub of the system. Control the frequency and stuff of the system. Also control settings of the base security system.
2. Remote Terminal - connects to base terminal through its frequency. also changes settings of the base security system.
3. Card Reader - Scans cards. simple as that.
4. Card Writer - Write the cards. yas
5. Access Junction - Device you can connect all components (card reader, doors, etc.) that work as one. eg: connect two readers and one door, so that both readers allow you to open that one door.
6. Sector Junction - a simpler version of the access junction which only connects to doors and redstone outputs to allow the control of whether it is open or closed.
7. Alarm - a loud noise thingy that hurts ears lol. Can be connected to by sector & access junctions to sound an alarm if the door is shut or open and stuff.
8. Motion Sensor - detects motion in a radius. Can be configured to sound an alarm or open a door if needed.
9. Laser - detects an entity passing through. Can be configured to sound an alarm or open a door if needed.
10. MOOOOOORE if I think of it :)

Stuff I think would be cool if I learned it
1. Animations - I think it'd be cool if it showed the player swiping the card.
2. Card Reader (multi-user mode) - require the user to keep the card in the slot and wait for all readers to be activated to open the door. Good for roleplays and would use the animations.
3. ID card - a wearable ID card that, if the player is right clicked on, shows credentials. Good roleplay item.
